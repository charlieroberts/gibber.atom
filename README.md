# Gibber

This package enables the audio component of Gibber (http://www.charlie-roberts.com/gibber) inside of Atom. Use Atom to compose and live code music and audio!

## Getting Started

* Install Gibber using Atom's package manager.
* Enable Gibber by toggling it from your Packages menu.
* Enter some Gibber code, perhaps:
`mydrums = EDrums('x*ox*xo-')`
* Select the code and hit Ctrl-Enter to execute it. Ctrl-Shift-Enter executes the code at the start of the next musical measure.
* Play around with the tutorials at http://gibber.cc to learn more!
